## Advanced Group By Exercises

By now you've learned the fundamentals of `dplyr`: the five data manipulation verbs and the additional `group_by()` function to discover interesting group-wise statistics. This exercise brings together these concepts and provides you with an opportunity to combine them to answer some interesting questions.

Let us suppose we want to find the most visited destination for each carrier. Before reading ahead, please spend a couple of minutes thinking about how you might go about solving this exercise using dplyr.

As this is the first time you are combining multiple dplyr concepts, we have broken this exercise down into smaller steps. Each step will allow you to focus on a specific concept.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(hflights)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
hflights %>% ___
```

*** =type1:NormalExercise
*** =key1: 421e55e2ec

*** =xp1: 30

*** =instructions1
Compute for every carrier, the aggregate number of visits to each destination.

*** =solution1
```{r}
hflights %>%
  group_by(UniqueCarrier, Dest) %>%
  summarise(n = n())
```

*** =sct1
```{r}
# no sct yet
```

*** =type2:NormalExercise
*** =key2: 6eb56c5f40

*** =xp2: 30

*** =instructions2
Rank the aggregate number of visits for every carrier.

*** =solution2
```{r}
hflights %>%
  group_by(UniqueCarrier, Dest) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(n)))
```

*** =sct2
```{r}
# no sct yet
```

*** =type3:NormalExercise
*** =key3: be3d94b96c

*** =xp3: 30

*** =instructions3

Filter the results to only return the top ranked destination for every carrier.

*** =solution3

```{r}
hflights %>%
  group_by(UniqueCarrier, Dest) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(n))) %>%
  filter(rank == 1)
```

*** =sct3
```{r}
# no sct yet
```

## Selecting groups or parts of groups

The previous exercise illustrated how you can manually set a key via `setkey(DT, A, B)`. `setkey()` sorts the data by the columns that you specify and changes the table by reference. Having set a key will allow you to use it, for example, as a super-charged row name when doing selections. Arguments like `mult` and `nomatch` then help you to select only particular parts of groups.

For this exercise, we have already created a new data table named `DT` with keys set to `A` and `B`.

```r
# The 'keyed' data.table DT
DT <- data.table(
  A = letters[c(2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)],
  B = c(5, 4, 1, 9, 8, 8, 6),
  C = 6:12
)
setkey(DT, A, B)
```

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(data.table)
DT <- data.table(
  A = letters[c(2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)],
  B = c(5, 4, 1, 9, 8, 8, 6),
  C = 6:12
)
setkey(DT, A, B)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# enter your code here
```

*** =type1:NormalExercise
*** =key1: 5974659a43

*** =xp1: 30

*** =instructions1
Select the "b" group without using ==.

*** =solution1

```{r}
# Select the "b" group
DT["b"]
```

*** =sct1
```{r}
# no sct yet
```

*** =type2:NormalExercise
*** =key2: cf4ca03986

*** =xp2: 30

*** =instructions2
Select the "b" and "c" groups, without using ==.

*** =solution2
```{r}
# Select the "b" and "c" groups
DT[c("b", "c")]
```

*** =sct2
```{r}
# no sct yet
```

*** =type3:NormalExercise
*** =key3: e1b2784d0e

*** =xp3: 30

*** =instructions3
Select the first row of the "b" and "c" groups using `mult`.

*** =solution3
```{r}
# The first row of the "b" and "c" groups
DT[c("b", "c"), mult = "first"]
```

*** =sct3
```{r}
# no sct yet
```

*** =type4:NormalExercise
*** =key4: 0493afe637

*** =xp4: 30

*** =instructions4
Select the first and last row of the "b" and "c" groups. You will need to use `by = .EACHI` and `.SD`

*** =solution4

```{r}
# First and last row of the "b" and "c" groups
DT[c("b", "c"), .SD[c(1, .N)], by = .EACHI]
```

*** =sct4
```{r}
# no sct yet
```

*** =type5:NormalExercise
*** =key5: 1942879c17

*** =xp5: 30

*** =instructions5
Select the first and last row of the "b" and "c" groups and print out the group before returning the tables.

*** =hint5
You can use curly brackets to include two separate instructions inside the `j` argument.

*** =solution5
```{r}
# First and last row of the "b" and "c" groups
DT[c("b", "c"), {print(.SD); .SD[c(1, .N)]}, by = .EACHI]
```

*** =sct5
```{r}
# no sct yet
```
